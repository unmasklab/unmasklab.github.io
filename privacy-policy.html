        <h1>Privacy Policy for <span class="app-name">Unmask Lab</span></h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 11, 2026</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Unmask Lab ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our photo capture and facial feature detection application.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Photo capture, storage, and feature detection happen on your device. Photos you take are stored locally in the app’s private storage unless you choose to export them to Photos. The App also displays ads (Google AdMob) and uses crash/diagnostic reporting (Sentry).</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
        <p>To provide the App’s functionality, we request access to the following device features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> Required to capture photos for facial feature detection and extraction.</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Library (Optional - Add Only):</strong> Only required if you choose to save/export an image from the App to your device’s Photos library. The App does not import or browse your Photos library.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Facial Feature Processing</h2>
        <p>Unmask Lab performs facial feature detection on your device and can generate images based on selected feature types, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Skin regions</li>
            <li>Hair</li>
            <li>Teeth</li>
            <li>Glasses</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Feature processing happens on-device. Unmask Lab does not require you to create an account, and it does not upload your photos for processing.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All photos and extracted facial feature images are saved within the app's private sandboxed storage on your device. This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photos are stored securely within the app and cannot be accessed by other apps</li>
            <li>You can optionally export photos to your Photos library for sharing or backup</li>
            <li>We do not upload any images to external servers</li>
            <li>We do not create backups of your photos on our systems</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app will delete all photos stored within the app</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We do not share your in-app photos with third parties unless you choose to share/export them using iOS features (e.g., Share Sheet or saving to Photos).</p>
        <p>The App uses third-party services for advertising and diagnostics. These providers may receive certain device and usage information as described below.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Unmask Lab uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob (Advertising):</strong> We use Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to display banner ads in the App. AdMob may collect device information and approximate location (derived from IP address), and may use identifiers and interaction data to measure ad performance and deliver ads. If you allow tracking on iOS (AppTrackingTransparency prompt), AdMob and its partners may also use the device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) for personalized advertising and measurement. If you deny tracking, ads may be less personalized.</li>
            <li><strong>Sentry (Diagnostics / Crash Reporting):</strong> We use Sentry to help detect crashes and diagnose issues. Diagnostic events may include app version, device model, iOS version, and error details. We configure Sentry to minimize personal data collection (for example, we do not require accounts and do not intentionally collect your identity). For more information, see Sentry’s privacy policy: <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/">sentry.io/privacy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These services are provided by their respective companies and are subject to their own privacy policies. Google’s privacy policy is available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Photos are stored within the app until you delete them through the Gallery. Uninstalling the app will permanently delete photos stored within the app. Photos you export to your Photos library will remain there until you delete them separately. Diagnostic data sent to Sentry is retained according to our Sentry project settings.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can grant or revoke camera and photo library permissions at any time through iOS Settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Ad Tracking:</strong> If prompted, you can allow or deny tracking for ad personalization and measurement. You can also manage tracking permissions anytime in iOS Settings.</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Photos:</strong> You can view, export, and delete any photos through the app's built-in gallery.</li>
            <li><strong>Export:</strong> You can export photos to your device's Photo Library for sharing or backup.</li>
            <li><strong>App Removal:</strong> Uninstalling the App permanently deletes all photos stored within the app. Photos exported to your Photo Library will remain.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Unmask Lab is not directed at children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>Your data security is ensured by Apple's iOS security architecture. All photos and processing remain within your device's secure storage. We have no access to your device or its contents.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
        
        <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the App's privacy practices, please contact us:</p>
